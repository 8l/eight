missing from test.8 is coverage for:
atpend
empty elipsis args


Okey dokes. For me to be happy with the web implementation, I want:

elipsis args
a way to insert functions
continuations
signals


builtins:
call/cc
signal
set
setinfo
info
cons
car
cdr
oif
leak
quote

I think I can do that by the end of the week.

Longer term:
O man a real, read-macro-capable parser would be the UNBEATABLE.
