Eight is pretty easy to learn. Here is how it works. There are some basic types:


Symbols: build-spit, ham, cow-or-not, labia!, +, and others.

Symbols are represented by a word (dashes, exclamation points, and question marks are fine --- but don't use spaces, apostrophes, commas, asterices, or ampersands!).

Symbols can be bound to other objects --- like a variable in other languages:
-> (set! one-hand 5)
5
-> one-hand
5
Now one hand is 'bound' to the number five, and will be replaced by five in simple expressions:
-> (+ 5 2)
7
-> (+ one-hand 2)
7
Note that symbols are objects of their own right --- if you've never used a lisp-like language, this may come as a bit of a shock. You'll catch on quickly, though!

Integers: 1, 3, 2, 6, 49,324,261, etc.

Your basic integer is limited in range, depending on the machine that Eight is running on. [This is not, in fact, a problem --- as you'll soon see.]

Characters: a, G, %, K, ., and so on.

Characters are characters like letters or symbols; you'll rarely deal with them individually.

Lists: (1 build-spit "g" ham), (5), ()
